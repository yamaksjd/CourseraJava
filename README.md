# ðŸ“š Coursera JavaScript Essentials Labs

This repository contains the labs and exercises I've completed as part of the **JavaScript Essentials course** on **Coursera**.

I'm currently using this course to **polish and solidify my JavaScript knowledge** before moving on to more advanced topics like **React, Node.js, and MongoDB**.

Each folder includes the code from specific lessons or assignments I completed.

> Note: This repo is mostly for personal reference and practice â€” it's not a full project, but a space to track my learning progress.
